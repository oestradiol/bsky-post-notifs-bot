# Bluesky Watcher Bot - Post Notification Watcher

## Summary

Here's a summary of what this README.md covers. I tried to be as comprehensive as possible, to help both end users and anyone that wants to self-host this.

#### For End Users:

The only relevant section is probably [2.1 How to Use](#21-how-to-use). So you might as well just skip to that.

#### For maintainers, self-hosters, contributors:

I recommend reading the entire readme, or whatever sections below might help you. It covers all of the important aspects, really. The code is also properly documented, and I tried to make the variables self-explanatory for clarity, too.

### 1. Special Thanks

Special thanks to [Yoshihiro Sugi](https://github.com/sugyan), the author of **ATrium**, a collection of Rust libraries designed to work with the AT Protocol. ATrium successfully provided a versatile and coherent ecosystem that made the development of this bot possible and smooth.

Deep appreciation for the dedication and continuous development of ATrium, and I am grateful for the ongoing improvements.
Yoshihiro-san also was quick to help me when I had issues with it, as you can see [in this closed issue](https://github.com/sugyan/atrium/issues/220).

### 2. Overall Description

This **Bluesky Bot**, named **Watcher**, is designed to subscribe to post notifications from specific users on the Bluesky platform and notify listeners in real-time (check the next section if you plan on using this service!). Built using the [ATrium](https://github.com/sugyan/atrium) library, Watcher efficiently tracks posts and replies by interacting with the Bluesky API, checking each user only once every 15 seconds.

Watcher is capable of monitoring multiple users simultaneously and employs [Tokio](https://tokio.rs/) to manage these tasks efficiently. It also includes a logging system to track all events and operations.

Utilizing Discord webhooks, Watcher sends real-time updates to a specified Discord channel, keeping the maintainer informed of important activities, including failures and changes in the watchlist. [The level of the logs can be configured with an environment variable](#52-environment-variables). Additionally, the bot features session caching to minimize repeated authentication.

The bot is designed with robust error resilience, including a retry mechanism for API failures, connection issues, and invalid user inputs. This ensures continuous operation even in the face of temporary disruptions.

This bot is developed on top of the latest version of Rust, that currently being 1.81.

### 2.1 How to Use

The Watcher is operated directly through the Bluesky platform. Users can interact with the bot by sending specific commands via direct message (DM) to manage which users they want to watch for post notifications.

#### Available Commands:

- `!watch @user_1.handle @user_2.handle (...)`: Add one or more users to your watchlist. The bot will notify you whenever these users post or reply to posts. (NOTICE: Currently, listening to replies is not really implemented, but the bot is structured to allow for such as an opt-in. If you really want this feature, [feel free to contribute](#6-contributions)!)
  
- `!unwatch @user_1.handle @user_2.handle (...)`: Remove one or more users from your watchlist, stopping notifications for their posts or replies.

- `!list_watched`: View a list of all users you are currently watching.

- `!help`: Displays the available commands and their usage.

#### **Opting Out**

Respect for user privacy and consent is a core guideline for this bot. If you wish to opt out of notifications, you can simply block the bot on Bluesky. This action will prevent the bot from sending you any notifications, and your decision will be respected immediately.

### 3. Current Features

The Watcher comes with a variety of features designed to provide efficient and reliable notifications for users. 

#### **Key Features:**

- **Post Notifications**: Subscribes to posts and replies from specified users and sends real-time updates to listeners. This is done concurrently, without blocking the main threads.

- **Discord Webhooks**: Integrates with Discord to notify a channel about updates, ensuring immediate awareness of important logs (errors, warnings).

- **Session Caching**: Caches sessions to reduce repeated authentication.

- **Sqlite Storage**: Utilizes Sqlite to cache the bot's state, ensuring persistence across restarts. This allows the bot to recover its state and resume operations without losing data. This is done concurrently, without blocking the main threads.

- **In-Memory Repository**: Implements an in-memory repository for fast concurrent access to the watchlist and notifications, enhancing responsiveness and efficiency.

- **Graceful Shutdown**: Ensures that the Sqlite database disconnects gracefully before the bot shuts down, maintaining data integrity and preventing corruption.

- **Logging System**: Tracks all significant events and operations within the bot, providing detailed logs for monitoring and debugging. This is done concurrently, without blocking the main threads.

### 3.1 Error Handling

The Watcher is designed to handle a range of errors and potential issues gracefully, ensuring minimal disruption to its functionality.

#### **API and Bluesky Errors**

- **Retry Mechanism**: The bot attempts to issue requests and handle errors by retrying up to [`PER_REQ_MAX_RETRIES`](https://github.com/oestradiol/bsky-post-notifs-bot/blob/main/src/other/bsky/lib.rs#L158). This helps prevent single failures from interrupting the botâ€™s workflow. Authentication errors are managed by reauthenticating as needed.
  
- **Error Handling**: Expected errors are managed accordingly, and persistent issues are flagged as `Api` or `BskyBug` errors, particularly if they are related to the Bluesky API.

#### **ATrium Bugs**

- **Bug Handling**: The bot includes safeguards to manage potential bugs in the ATrium library. These are addressed as they occur.

#### **Database Errors**

- **Sqlite Robustness**: Sqlite is known for its robustness, so database errors are rare. However, any issues that do arise are handled with appropriate error logging.

#### **API Failures**

- If API failures occur, the bot will retry in incrementing intervals [(1s, up to `INCREMENTS_LIMIT`, for a maximum of `MINUTES_LIMIT`)](https://github.com/oestradiol/bsky-post-notifs-bot/blob/main/src/other/utils/handle_api_failure.rs#L6). This is to mitigate temporary issues and ensure continued operation.

#### **Bluesky Bugs**

- The bot is prepared to handle any possible Bluesky bugs. It should log those comprehensively, so that the maintainer can ask for help and possibly [contribute to the project](https://github.com/bluesky-social/atproto).

#### **Other Errors**

- **Command Handling Failures**: The bot handles cached commands. Command failures are logged, but the bot does not notify the user about the failure, as currently any command failure is caused by a failure in contacting the API, so it's unfeasible to notify the user anyways. This means that failed commands need to be reissued.

- **Command Listener Failures**: The bot listens for new commands and [fetches unread conversations periodically](https://github.com/oestradiol/bsky-post-notifs-bot/blob/main/src/other/services/jobs/command_listener.rs#L11). Failures are logged, and the job will cancel if the error is deemed unrecoverable. Persistent failures will cause the bot to stop listening for new commands. By consequence, this also cancels the command handling task.

- **Post Watching Failures**: Watching users' posts and notifying watchers is [done periodically](https://github.com/oestradiol/bsky-post-notifs-bot/blob/main/src/other/services/jobs/user_watcher.rs#L26). If failures occur, they are logged, and the job will cancel if the error is unrecoverable.

#### **Panic Scenarios**

- **Signal Handlers**: Panics if signal handlers for SIGTERM/SIGINT fail to install. This is crucial for handling termination signals properly.

- **Environment Variables**: Panics if required environment variables are not found or fail to parse correctly. Ensure all necessary variables are defined and correctly formatted.

- **Database Initialization**: Panics if the connection pool fails to initialize. This occurs if there are issues with creating or connecting to the database file.

- **Logging System**: Panics if the logging system fails to initialize, usually due to issues with environment variable definitions for log directory and severity level.

**Note**: Most panics occur during the initial setup, often related to environment configuration issues. Once initialized, the bot is designed to handle errors robustly.

### 3.2 TODOs

The following features and improvements are planned for future development:

- **`with_replies` feature**: [Develop the `posts_with_replies` filter](https://github.com/oestradiol/bsky-post-notifs-bot/blob/main/src/other/bsky/get_last_post_time.rs#L22) to distinguish between replies and regular posts. This will enhance notification management for users who also want to be notified for replies.

- **Rate Limiting**: Analyze how the ATProto APIs handle rate limiting and [implement a more robust solution](https://github.com/oestradiol/bsky-post-notifs-bot/blob/main/src/other/bsky/lib.rs#L183) to manage potential rate limits.

- **Configuration for Invalid Messages and Unknown Commands**: Creating a configuration file for customizing the response message for invalid messages and unknown commands. Currently, the messages are hard-coded ([occurrence 1](https://github.com/oestradiol/bsky-post-notifs-bot/blob/main/src/other/services/commands/invalid.rs#L7), [occurrence 2](https://github.com/oestradiol/bsky-post-notifs-bot/blob/main/src/other/services/commands/unknown.rs#L7)).

### 5. Running and Building

To run **Watcher**, follow the instructions below for different environments and setups.

#### 5.1 Makefile

The Makefile provides convenient commands for building, testing, and running the bot. Available commands:

- **`make clean`**: Cleans up build artifacts and logs while keeping the `.env` file.
- **`make build`**: Builds the bot and copies the executable and `.env` file to the `dist` directory.
- **`make lint`**: Runs the linter for the codebase.
- **`make lint-fix`**: Automatically fixes linting issues.
- **`make force-lint-fix`**: Forces linting fixes even for dirty or staged files.
- **`make dev`**: Runs the bot in development mode with full span tracing and backtraces, while still respecting the `LOG_SEVERITY` environment variable.
- **`make prod`**: Builds and runs the bot in production mode.

#### 5.2 Environment Variables

Watcher requires several environment variables to function correctly. Ensure at least the required ones (the ones that don't have a default value) are set in your `.env` file or your environment:

- **`LOG_SEVERITY`**: Defines the severity level for logging (defaults to `INFO`).
- **`LOG_DIRECTORY`**: Directory where log files are stored (defaults to `/var/log/post_watcher`).
- **`DATABASE_URL`**: URL for the database (defaults to `sqlite://data.db`).
- **`DB_CONN_POOL_MAX`**: Maximum number of database connections (defaults to `100`).
- **`DISCORD_WEBHOOK`**: The Discord Webhook URL (does not have a default value, however this feature will be disabled if undefined).
- **`BOT_USERNAME`**: The bot's username on Bluesky.
- **`BOT_PASSWORD`**: The bot's password or app password.

An example `.env` file is provided as `.env.example`.

#### 5.3 Production Deployment

For production deployment:

1. **Build Watcher**: Use `make build` to compile the bot and prepare the executable.
2. **Run Watcher**: Navigate to the `dist` directory and execute `./app` to start the bot.

Alternatively, you can run `make prod` to do both of the commands above at once.

After that, you can copy the `dist` directory wherever you prefer and delete the rest of the source code.

Ensure all environment variables are set correctly before running the bot.

#### 5.4 Docker Deployment (untested)

NOTICE: This section and the corresponding Dockerfile are untested, but it _should_ hopefully work.

To deploy the bot using Docker, follow these steps:

1. **Build the Docker Image**:

  ```bash
  docker build -t watch-bot .
  ```

2. **Run the Docker Container**:

  ```bash
  docker run -d --name watch-bot -e BOT_USERNAME=<your_bot_username> -e BOT_PASSWORD=<your_bot_password>
  ```

Make sure to replace `<your_bot_username>` and `<your_bot_password>` with your actual bot credentials.

### 7. FAQ / Troubleshooting

**Q: What should I do if the bot is not sending notifications?**  
A: Check the bot's logs for errors. Ensure the bot has the correct permissions and that the environment variables are properly set.

**Q: How can I check if the bot is properly connected to Bluesky?**  
A: Verify the bot's authentication details and check the connection status in the logs. Make sure your credentials are correct.

**Q: The bot crashed or stopped working. What should I do?**  
A: Review the logs for any critical errors or panics. Restart the bot and monitor for recurring issues. If the problem persists, consider reporting it on the GitHub repository.

**Q: How can I update the bot to the latest version?**  
A: Pull the latest changes from the repository, rebuild the bot using `make build`, and redeploy it.

**Q: The bot is not responding to commands, or receiving any at all. What could be wrong?**  
A: If you are an end user, contact the maintainer. If you are the maintainer, first, ensure that the bot account has DMs opened for anyone. You can do that in the settings of your Bluesky account. Then, ensure that the commands sent by the users are correctly formatted and that the bot is actively listening for new commands. Check the logs for any errors related to command processing.

**Q: How do I opt out of notifications?**  
A: You can block the bot on Bluesky to opt out of notifications from it. The bot respects user privacy and will stop sending notifications if blocked.
